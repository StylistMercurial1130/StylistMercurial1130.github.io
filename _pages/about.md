Hi I am Karthik Venkatesh, from Bengaluru, India. I am a Software Developer with about 2 years of experience. I currently work at Opentext. The domain I work at my job is IAM (Identity Access Management). But if you were to ask me what is it that I do when I step outside of my work... thats where things get quite interesting. I have quite the eclectic range with respect to what I as a engineer am passioniate about, but to maintain sufficient brevity as to not bore the person reading this, I am interested into anything that has to do with low level systems, compilers, databases and computer graphics. I know its quite over the place, but thats just me. I am in no way saying thats what my software engineering career has been like, its been mostly just the same boring old dotnet,c++ and windows related development.
